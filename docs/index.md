# Example page

Hello there! This is an example documentation page for [Viewdocs](http://viewdocs.io), a super-lightweight project documentation platform inspired by [Gist.io](http://gist.io).

Now look up. _Further_. Above the post title. See that grey text?

Now back to me. That grey text is a link! Open that sucker in a new tab to see the project for this documentation.
